// Lexical environment = EC's Local Memory + Reference to Lexical Environment of its parent.

// 1) Lexical Environment of its parent is the scope where a function is physically present or defined. So, suppose a function x(), is defined and invoked in the GEC, when function x()'s EC is pushed in the call stack, it stores a reference to its parent's lexical environment i.e. the GEC's memory.

// 2) Whenever a new Execution Context is pushed in the Call Stack it holds a reference to the Lexical Environment of its parent, i.e. the EC's memory from where it was invoked.

// 3) Global execution context holds reference to null.

// 4)  Javascript engine first looks for the variable/function being accessed in the local scope of the function, and if not found, it keeps on searching the lexical environment of its parent until it finds the variable/function being accessed.

// 5) The mechanism mentioned in point 4 above is called SCOPE CHAIN.

// 6) If the variable accessed is not found in the Scope Chain, then you will get the variable is not defined error in the  browser's console.
